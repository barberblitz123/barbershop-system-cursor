## Table Structure

### Users Table/Collection
\`\`\`
users/
  â”œâ”€ {userId}/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ email: string
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ name: string
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ role: string ("user", "admin")
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ profileImage: string (optional)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ createdAt: timestamp
  â”‚   â””â”€ updatedAt: timestamp
\`\`\`

### Settings Table/Collection
\`\`\`
settings/
  â”œâ”€ {settingId}/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ key: string
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ value: any
  â”‚   â”œâ”€ description: string
  â”‚   â””â”€ updatedAt: timestamp
\`\`\`

## Security Rules

\`\`\`javascript
// Basic security rules
// 1. Users can only read/write their own data
// 2. Admins can read/write all data
// 3. Settings can be read by all authenticated users
\`\`\`

## Indexes

The following indexes are required for the application:

1. Users table/collection:
   - Index on \`email\` for faster lookup
   - Index on \`role\` for filtering by role

## Data Validation

- Emails must be unique
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters
- Required fields cannot be null or empty

## Common Queries

### Get User By Email
\`\`\`javascript
const getUserByEmail = async (email) => {
  // Query implementation depends on database technology
  // This is a pseudocode example
  return db.users.findOne({ email });
};
\`\`\`

### Update User Profile
\`\`\`javascript
const updateUserProfile = async (userId, profileData) => {
  // Query implementation depends on database technology
  // This is a pseudocode example
  return db.users.update(
    { id: userId },
    { 
      ...profileData,
      updatedAt: new Date()
    }
  );
};

# Create CURSOR_BEST_PRACTICES.md
cat > "$PROJECT_PATH/CURSOR_BEST_PRACTICES.md" << EOL
# Cursor Best Practices for $PROJECT_NAME

This document outlines the best practices for using Cursor with this project.

## Essential Files

### \`.cursorrules\`

The \`.cursorrules\` file in the root directory provides essential context about the project. It includes:

- Project overview and vision
- Personality instructions for Cursor
- Tech stack details
- Environment variables
- File structure
- Process definitions
- Important instructions

Always keep this file updated as the project evolves.

### \`.cursorignoree\`

The \`.cursorignoree\` file prevents Cursor from accidentally modifying sensitive files like:

- Environment variables
- Generated files
- Binary files
- Lock files

### Specialized Markdown Files

We maintain specialized markdown files in the \`instructions/\` directory:

- \`database-setup.md\`: Database structure, security rules, and common queries
- \`ui-design-principles.md\`: Design system, colors, typography, and component guidelines
- \`roadmap.md\`: Current focus, priorities, and future plans

Tag these files when working on related features to provide context.

## Prompting Techniques

### Effective Prompts

- **"The fewer lines of code, the better"**: Encourages minimal, clean implementations
- **"Proceed like a senior developer"**: Produces more professional, maintainable code
- **"Do not stop working until you've implemented this feature fully and completely"**: Reduces laziness
- **"Start by writing three reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be"**: Forces thorough analysis before jumping to conclusions
- **"Answer in short"**: Reduces verbosity
- **"Do not delete comments"**: Preserves important context

### Prompt Structure

1. **Explanation**: 2-4 sentences explaining what you're doing
2. **File Tags**: Tag relevant files using \`@filename\`
3. **Instructions**: How to execute, what not to do
4. **Context**: Documentation, examples, or other relevant information
5. **Core Instruction**: Repeat the most important instruction
6. **Output Format**: Specify how you want the response formatted

## Comments

Comments are extremely important in this codebase:

- **File Headers**: Include file path and purpose at the top of each file
- **Function Documentation**: Document parameters, return values, and behavior
- **Complex Logic**: Explain non-obvious code
- **TODO Items**: Mark areas for future improvement
- **References**: Link to related files or components

Aim for 1 line of comments for every 3-4 lines of code.

## When to Use Different Tools

### Cursor Composer vs. Chat

- **Composer**: For making code changes, implementing features, or complex refactoring
- **Chat**: For asking questions, getting explanations, or listing information

### When to Create a New Composer

Create a new composer when:
- The context window seems overloaded
- Cursor starts behaving strangely or forgetting key information
- You're switching to a completely different task

Before switching, use the "summary of current state" prompt to capture important context.

## Error Fixing

When encountering errors:

1. Have Cursor explain what information it needs to debug
2. Provide the requested information
3. Ask Cursor to write three reasoning paragraphs before proposing a solution
4. Break down complex fixes into steps
5. Test after each step

Remember that Cursor has a knowledge cutoff date and may not be aware of the latest updates to libraries or frameworks. Always verify with official documentation when in doubt.
